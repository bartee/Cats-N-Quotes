Cats-N-Quotes
===========

A Django-app that renders a random quote.
- add quotes with a cheeky callback, and a Gravatar-email address. As much as you like. 
- Visit the homepage, and behold. A hero-unit.
- It has pictures of cats in the background
- Both MySQL-Python and psycopg2 are in the requirements. Make your choice. 

To set it up, add your local_settings.py with the appropriate database-config for 'default'.
